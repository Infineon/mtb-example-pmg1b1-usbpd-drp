# EZ-PD&trade; PMG1B1 MCU: USBPD dual-role power (DRP)

This code example demonstrates USB Type-C attach detection and USB Power Delivery contract negotiation using EZ-PD&trade; PMG1B1 MCU devices as a dual-role power (DRP) controller. In the Sink mode, the EZ-PD™ PMG1B1 MCU can negotiate upto 100W (20V @ 5A) over the USB-C port and convert the negotiated USB-C VBUS voltage to 20 V output using the integrated buck boost peripheral. In Source mode, the EZ-PD™ PMG1B1 MCU can source up to 27W (9V @ 3A).

</details>

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.
The following example clones the "[USBPD DRP](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-pmg1b1-usbpd-drp)" application with the desired name "MyUsbPdDrp" configured for the *EVAL_PMG1_B1_DRP* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id EVAL_PMG1_B1_DRP --app-id mtb-example-pmg1b1-usbpd-drp --user-app-name MyUsbPdDrp --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

>**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal using the `make library-manager` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool "library-manager-cli" to change the BSP.

The "library-manager-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--add-bsp-name` | Name of the BSP that should be added to the application | Required
`--set-active-bsp` | Name of the BSP that should be as active BSP for the application | Required

</details>

## Operation

1. Ensure that the steps listed in the [Hardware setup](#hardware-setup) section are completed.

2. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

1. Connect a PD sink device and EZ-PD&trade; Protocol Analyzer on the USBPD port of the kit to confirm the PD source functionality. The PD contract is observed on the Protocol Analyzer connected.

2. Similarly, remove the 24-V power adapter and connect a PD source to the USBPD port of the DRP kit and confirm the PD sink functionality using the protocol analyzer, as in the former case. A multimeter may be used to measure the coverted VBUS Voltage at the output load terminals (J9).
 
 - LED3 (STATUS LED) is ON indicating the Source mode of operation, LED4 (POWER LED) indicates board is powered. 

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. Ensure that the board is connected to your PC using the USB cable connected to the programming/debugging port of the kit. See the "Debug mode" section in the kit user guide.

For more details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

## Design and implementation

EZ-PD&trade; PMG1 MCU devices support a USBPD block that integrates Type-C terminations, comparators, and the Power Delivery transceiver required to detect the attachment of a partner device and negotiate power contracts with it. In addition to the USBPD block , the EZ-PD&trade; PMG1 MCU also integrates a buck boost subsytem that can convert the negotiated USB-C VBUS Voltage to required output. 

On reset, the application initializes the USBPD block and buck boost block with the following settings:

   - The receiver clock input of the block is connected to a 12-MHz PERI-derived clock

   - The transmitter clock input of the block is connected to a 600-kHz PERI-derived clock

   - The SAR ADC clock input of the block is connected to a 1-MHz PERI-derived clock

   - The SAR ADC in the USBPD block is configured to measure the VBUS_TYPE-C voltage through an internal divider

   - The buck boost clock input of the block is connected to a 24-MHz PERI-derived clock
   
   - The VBUS voltage and current transition clocks are set to 24-KHz PERI-derived clock
   
   - The buck boost PWM operating mode is set to FCCM and PWM Frequency is set to 400-KHz

   - The buck boost is initialized with 400-KHz PWM frequency and FCCM mode

   - The buck boost output voltage is initialized to 20 V

This application uses the PDStack Middleware Library in a DRP role. EZ-PD&trade; PMG1 MCU devices have a dead-battery Rd termination, which ensures that a USB-C source/charger connected to it can detect the presence of a sink even when the EZ-PD&trade; PMG1 MCU device is not powered as shown in **Figure 1**.

**Figure 1. Firmware flowchart**

<img src = "images/usbpd_drp_flow.png" width = "400"/>
<br>

The PDStack Middleware Library configures the USBPD block on the EZ-PD&trade; PMG1 MCU device to detect Type-C connection state changes and USBPD messages, and notify the stack through callback functions. The callback function registers the pending tasks, which are then handled by PDStack through the `Cy_PdStack_Dpm_Task` function. This function is expected to be called at appropriate times from the main processing loop of the application.

**Figure 2. PDStack task flowchart**

<img src = "images/pdstacktask.png" width = "600"/>

<br>

The PDStack Middleware Library implements the state machines defined in the [USB Type-C Cable and Connector](https://www.usb.org/document-library/usb-type-cr-cable-and-connector-specification-revision-20) and the [USB Power Delivery](https://www.usb.org/document-library/usb-power-delivery) specifications. PDStack consists of the following main modules:

- **Type-C Manager:** Responsible for detecting a Type-C connection and identifying the type of connection. It uses the configurable Rp/Rd terminations provided by the USBPD block and the internal line state comparators. The Type-C manager implements the state machines defined in the **USB Type-C Cable and Connector specification** and provides the following functionality:

    - **Manage CC terminations**: Applies Rp/Rd terminations according to the port role

    - **Attach detection**: Perform the required debounce and determine the type of device attached

    - **Detach detection**: Monitor the CC line and VBus for detecting a device detach

- **Protocol Layer:** Forms the messages used to communicate between a pair of ports/cable plugs. It is responsible for forming capabilities messages, requests, responses, and acknowledgements. It receives inputs from the Policy Engine indicating which messages to send and relays the responses back to the policy engine.

- **Policy Engine:** Provides a mechanism to monitor and control the USB Power Delivery system within a particular consumer, provider, or cable plug. It implements the state machines defined in the **USB Power Delivery** specification and contains implementations of all PD atomic message sequences (AMS). It interfaces with the protocol layer for PD message transmission/reception for controlling the reception of message types according conditions such as the current state of the port. It also interfaces with the Type-C Manager for error conditions like Type-C error recovery.

- **Device Policy Manager (DPM):** Provides an interface to the application layer to initialize, monitor, and configure the PDStack middleware operation. The DPM provides the following functionality:

    - Initialize the Policy Engine and Type-C Manager

    - Start the Type-C state machine followed by the Policy Engine state machine

    - Stop and disable the Type-C port

    - Allow entry/exit from Deep Sleep to achieve low-power based on the port status

    - Provide APIs for the application to send PD/Type-C commands

    - Provide event callbacks to the application for application-specific handling

The PDStack Library uses a set of callbacks registered by the application to perform board-specific tasks such as turning the consume or provider power path ON/OFF and identifying the optimal source power profile to be used for charging. In this example, these functions are implemented using the appropriate APIs provided as part of the Peripheral Driver Library (PDL).

The stack also provides notification of various connection and PD policy state changes so that the rest of the system can be configured as required.

The application configures the buck boost output voltage and current as set in the Device Configurator. The application periodically measures the onboard temperatures and also monitors for any fault. The application also tries to keep the EZ-PD&trade; PMG1 MCU device in Deep Sleep, where all clocks are disabled and only limited hardware blocks are enabled, for most of its working time. Interrupts in the USBPD block are configured to detect any changes that happens when the device is in sleep, and wake it up for further processing.

An overvoltage (OV) comparator in the USBPD block is used to detect cases where the power source is supplying incorrect voltage levels and automatically shut down the power switches to protect the rest of the components on the board.

### Compile-time configurations

The EZ-PD&trade; PMG1B1 MCU USBPD DRP application functionality can be customized through a set of compile-time parameters that can be turned ON/OFF through the *config.h* and *Makefile* header files.
